# About Microsoft FarmBeats

It is a venture of Microsoft Research currently in its public preview. Launched in 2015, by Dr. Ranveer Chandra, it aims to democratize Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things technologies to farmers globally.

These technologies usually comprise low-cost sensors, drones, vision, white space and Machine Learning algorithms. Together these can be used to tackle very little or no power and internet in farms which are some common problems faced in the rural areas.

## FarmBeats Student Kit

To promote the concept of FarmBeats among universities, Microsoft has collaborated with educational institutions and universities around the world. This involves teaching IoT concepts with Azure Cloud Services to students.

Hence, the FarmBeats student kit includes a Raspberry Pi as a microcontroller with preconfigured Microsoft Azure Cloud services with the following sensors:

- Temperature, Humidity and Pressure Sensor (BME280).
- Light sensor.
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor.

This GitHub repository is a one-stop-shop resource to learn about state-of-the-art digital agriculture and precision farming techniques. The user will learn how to build complex IoT products using Raspberry Pi and Microsoft Azure Cloud Computing Services. No prior experience is required.
