# **Scenario 3: LED Light system**
---

### **Description**

In this scenario, the student will be able to build their own LED light system. 
They will use the light intensity sensor to create an LED grow light system that optimises plant growth.

_**Additional equipment:** x5 LED lights (deep red, far red, blue, green, uv)._

### **Learning Outcomes**

- Learn how to use the data collected from the light intensity sensor.

- Build confidence with using IoT Central.

- Understand the importance of lighting quality/conditions in agriculture.

- Investigate using PWM for dimming techniques.

### **Key areas to teach**

Microsoft Azure Services, Voltage regulation/PWM.
