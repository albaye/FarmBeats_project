Build your Windows 10 IoT Core Sensor Device
============================================

This lab document is to help students with the FarmBeats Student Kit device
setup.

There are currently two variations of the Student Kit that are being distributed. 
- The quick version removes the steps required to install the software and extract the Device ID yourself
- The standard version guides students through the full device installation process as part of the learning experience 


The quick setup
---------------
To identify if you have the quick version, look on the bottom of your Raspeberry Pi. If your Raspberry Pi has a Device ID sticker on it then you have the quick version and you are not required to complete most of this setup section. 
 -  Instead go directly to [1b Assemble your FarmBeats Student Kit hardware](https://github.com/farmbeatslabs/studentkit/blob/master/Indoor-m1/1b_Assemble_your_FarmBeats_Student_Kit_Hardware.md)
 -  Then move on to [Step 2 - Registering your FarmBeats Student Kit User and Device](https://github.com/farmbeatslabs/studentkit/blob/master/Indoor-m1/2_Register_your_FarmBeats_Student_Kit_User_and_Device.md) 


The standard setup 
------------------
For the standard kit without this Device ID already extracted there are several sub steps that we have broken down into individual documents that you will need to follow before proceeding to Step 2:

-   [1a Install Windows 10 IoT Core on your SD
    Card](https://github.com/farmbeatslabs/studentkit/blob/master/Indoor-m1/1a_Install_Windows_10_IoT_Core_on_your_SD_card.md)
    (not required if your kit comes with a pre-installed SD Card)

-   [1b Assemble your FarmBeats Student Kit
    hardware](https://github.com/farmbeatslabs/studentkit/blob/master/Indoor-m1/1b_Assemble_your_FarmBeats_Student_Kit_Hardware.md)

-   [1c Identify your unique Device
    ID](https://github.com/farmbeatslabs/studentkit/blob/master/Indoor-m1/1c_Identify_your_unique_Device_ID.md)

-   [1d Install the FarmBeats Sensor
    Software](https://github.com/farmbeatslabs/studentkit/blob/master/Indoor-m1/1d_Install_the_FarmBeats_Sensor_Application_Software.md)

To complete this stage of the installation you will require:

-   A complete FarmBeats Student Kit with Raspberry Pi and Sensors

-   A Windows PC (not required if you received a pre-installed SD card)

-   The device password “p\@ssw0rd” (for pre-installed SD cards)

-   A mouse, keyboard and HDMI monitor

-   An internet connection (wired preferred)

-   A small Philips head screwdriver

-   The latest [FarmBeats Labs Sensor Application for the Indoor
    M1](https://fblassets.blob.core.windows.net/releases/FarmBeatsLabs.UWP.Headless_1.0.11.0_arm.zip)
    software.
