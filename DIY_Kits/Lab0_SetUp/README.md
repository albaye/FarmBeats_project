# DIY Kits

In this lab, you will learn to setup your own Raspberry Pi to follow the tutorials.

You will be using **Raspbian OS** which is based on unix, so their command are the same as Linux or MacOS. Most of the labs are preformed using terminal commands to control the Pi, so you will need to become familiar with them. 

Additionally we will be using **Grove system and sensor**. Grove is an electronics system that simplifies connections to hundreds of different sensors, so you can program them to monitor, control, and automate devices. Sensors included in the kit: soil moisture, light, air temperature and
humidity.

## Components Required

- 1 x Raspberry Pi

- 1 x Grove Base for Raspberry Pi

- 1 x Grove Soil Moisture Sensor

- 1 x Grove Temperature, Humidity & Barometer Sensor (BME280)

- 1 x Grove Light Sensor

- 3 x Grove 50cm Long Cables

- 1 x SD Card Micro of at least 8GB

- 1 x SD Card USB Adapter

- 1 x Power Supply & Cable

- 1 x Ethernet Cable

## Steps

- [Install Raspbian in your Micro SD Card](1a_Install_Raspian_on_your_SD_card.md)

- [Setup the sensors using Grove base](Sensors_Setup_Grove.md)

If you don't have a grove base, you can just learn how to set up the sensors using a breadboard and some jumper cables.
