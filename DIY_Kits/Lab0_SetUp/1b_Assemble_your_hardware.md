Assemble your DIY Sensor Device Hardware
============================================

This tutorial will show you how to assemble your hardware
so that you can connect to the internet and start collecting sensor data.

Preparation
-----------

- Please ensure that you have all the necessary [materials](Hardware_List.md) to build your sensor device.

- *Optional: if your Grove Base Hat includes screws for mounting onto a Raspberry Pi, you will also need a small screwdriver.*

Assembling your hardware
----------------

-   Add the Grove Base Hat to your Raspberry Pi. Match the end pins up and press
    down firmly. Look at it from all angles to ensure that it is correctly
    connected.

-   *Optional: screw in the supports on the side opposite the pins to stop the other side
    of the Grove Base Hat from collapsing onto the Raspberry Pi. This requires a
    small screwdriver.*

-   Plug the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor into socket A2. If you have a
    second one plug it into A4.

-   Once all your sensors are plugged in you should have something that looks
    like this.
