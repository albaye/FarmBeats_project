# **Scenario 3: Predict the weather**

## **Description**

Predict the chance of rain using machine learning to use it as a factor for the automatic irrigation system. There is no need to water the plant if there is a high chance of rain. The chance of rain is the output of a prepared weather prediction model. The model is built upon historic data to forecast chance of rain based on temperature and humidity. 

> You could compare the output of this model with that of Azure Maps in the previous step to check its validity.

### **Learning Outcomes**

- Learn how to use the sensor data in a machine learning model and use its output to trigger a command in IOT Central.

- Learn how to use Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) to do weather forecast (chance of rain) using the temperature and humidity data obtained from your Azure Event Hubs.

### **Key areas to teach**

AI, Azure services, Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic).
