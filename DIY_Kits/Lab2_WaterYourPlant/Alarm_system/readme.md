# Set Up a Notification System

Learn how to set up a notification system to alert the user when the plant being monitored needs to be watered. 

This lab covers how to add **Commands** to the device capabilities model in IoT Central and configure the **Rules** and **Actions** to send an email when the soil moisture is below a certain threshold. 


_Optionally a LED indicator can be integrated to indicate if the plant needs watering._

_Optional date and time last watered extension project_

## Lab Structure

- Investigate creating rules using Azure IoT Central
  - Send email or push notification when the soil moisture is below a certain threshold.

  - Optional: check if temperature/pressure/light intensity is outside the optimal range.

- Learn to use process sensor data using Azure Functions.
  - Stream data from IoT Central using Event Hubs and Stream Analytics
