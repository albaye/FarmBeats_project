Now you are able to control the LEDs lights from IoT Central. You can go further and implement an automatic switch on and off when light is needed.

For example, you can use the Light Sensor to measure the light, and if it is lower than a threshold, switch on some LEDs. Additionally you can try and imitate the sunlight by switching all colours with the required intensity. You can do this by using an **Azure Function App**.

If you feel this is too easy, you can dig onto when does the plant need a speceific wavelenght. For example, the lack of blue light may cause the plant to stunt (stop growing, dehydratation...). Hence, when you feel the plant is getting dehydrated very often, switch on the blue LED and see if it improves the situation.

Futhermore, you can try to implent all this in PowerApps just like you did in previous labs.
