#### **Objective**

Set up a system to alert the user when the plant needs to be watered.

#### **Learning outcomes**

- Investigate creating rules using Azure IoT Central
  - Send email or push notification when the soil moisture is below a certain threshold.

  - Optional: check if temperature/pressure/light intensity is outside the optimal range.

- Learn to use Azure Events Hub, Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Functions to process data.
  - Determine the date and time that the plant was last watered.

#### **Key areas to teach**

IoT Azure Services, Data, Microcontroller Programming, AI.

_Optionally a LED indicator can be integrated to indicate if the plant needs watering._
