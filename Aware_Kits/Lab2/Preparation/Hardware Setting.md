Mainly three sensors are used in this scenario. They are the Grove temperature and humidity sensor (GHT11), the Grove moisture sensor and the Grove red led.

Let's set up the **GHT11 sensor** first.

- Plug the Grove Base Hat into Raspberry Pi.

- Connect the temperature and humidity sensor to Port 12 of the Base Hat.
